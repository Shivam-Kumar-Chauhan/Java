//we have to calculate the CGPA percentage of five subjects( English, Hindi, Maths, Science and Social Study).
//CGPA ( Cumulative Grade Point Average ) is the systematic arrangement in the educational stream to get average of grade points. And the CGPA percentage is 9.5 times the CGPA.
//CGPA = (Grades in all Subjects) / (Total Number of Subjects).
//So, CGPA= 9.5 Ã— CGPA
